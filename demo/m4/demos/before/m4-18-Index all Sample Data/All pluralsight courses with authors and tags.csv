The fact is most will have to deal with legacy applications for some time to come. And to complicate matters further, typical business processes transcend multiple heterogeneous applications making them difficult to automate. In this course we look at how to use BizTalk Server (BTS) to bridge such integration gaps and simplify business process automation. By combining the connectivity provided by its messaging engine with the productivity provided by its orchestration engine, BizTalk Server can help you tackle tough business process scenarios in your connected systems today.",Live,no,Matt Milner,web-services biztalk microsoft distributed-systems developer web-services biztalk microsoft distributed-systems developer

But, it doesn’t have to be a painful experience. In this course, I’ll show you the basics of creating an iOS application as we build a complete iOS application learning what we need to know about Objective-C along the way. We’ll start out by learning a little bit about iOS in general and the iOS development environment. Then, we’ll jump right in and create out first Hello World iOS application as we set up our development environment and learn the basics of the IDE we use for iOS development, Xcode. After that, I’ll show you the core things you need to know to build any application, how to build a user interface and interact with it. We’ll learn how to use Xcode’s Interface Builder tool to create a very basic IU and interact with it. Once we’ve got the basics covered, we’ll start building our first real application. We’ll learn a few new concepts as we build our application, like how to use the iOS storyboarding feature to creating a multi-screen application and how to setup navigation in our application. Finally, we’ll finish up our iOS application by learning how to add user settings to the app and how to show the user a simple notification through the use of alerts. So, if you are looking to get started with iOS development and are looking for an easy and gentle way to get introduced to the environment and tools while building a real application, this course is exactly what you need.

In this course, I’ll take you through the complete process of creating an application that works on each of the platforms and uses a REST based backend API to share data and business logic—all using C#. We’ll start off this course by learning how to build a REST based API using the popular open source framework ServiceStack. I’ll show you how easy it is to get ServiceStack set up and even how to store data for the API using a Redis database. Next, I’ll show you how to create an ASP.NET MVC 4 application that uses the REST service we built to display it's data and implement it's logic. We’ll learn how to use JQuery to make AJAX calls to a REST based API from within our MVC 4 application. Then, we’ll learn how we can use C# and the .NET framework to build an Android application using the Xamarin tools. We’ll use the same REST API, we created earlier and build a real native Android application that is able to consume that API for implementing its logic and displaying data. Finally, I’ll show you how to do the same thing for an iOS application. We’ll again use C# to build a real native iOS application with the Xamarin tools and learn how to consume REST based web services from iOS. So, if you are a C# developer and don’t want to have to learn several other programming languages to build cross platform applications; you’ll definitely want to check out this course. By the end of this course, you’ll have the skills you need to be able to implement an end-to-end cross platform solution complete with a REST based API backend all in C#.",Live,no,John Sonmez,mvc ios xamarin web service-stack android developer mobile mvc ios xamarin web service-stack android developer mobile

And if you are going for a rich, stateful, interactive user experience, you won't want to be doing full page post backs to get that done. To work with the data on the client side, you'll need change tracking and validation of edits, the ability to filter, sort, and page data from the client side.

Breeze lets you quickly develop a good layered architecture on the client side in JavaScript, acting as a data layer, repository, or data gateway for your client side code. This course will walk you through all of the core features of Breeze. You'll learn how to execute queries from your client side JavaScript to retrieve data for presentation, work with the cached data on the client side, enable rich editing scenarios, handle changes to the data client side, validate that data, and send changes back to the server side.

After that, we'll check out the network panel and how to find out exactly what resources our pages are getting from the network, how long it is taking to get them, and what order all of this is happening in. Then, we'll head over to the sources panel and unveil the powerful built-in JavaScript debugging capabilities that Chrome has out of the box. (You won't want to miss this part.) We'll follow up with a quick review of the audits panel to see how it can give us some handy optimization tips for our pages. Then we'll dig into the timeline panel where we'll learn how to figure out exactly what is happening when a page is being displayed and how to optimize our pages to ensure the animation is never choppy. Finally, we'll wrap things up by seeing how the profiles panel can help us quickly identify performance problems with JavaScript or CSS selectors and also let us see into the scary realm of JavaScript memory management.

Applications need to be able to grow without being totally rewritten. Sure, there eventually comes a time when every app needs a major overhaul, but if applications are written to be extensible in the first place, the overhaul can be performed in pieces; and in the meantime, new features can be added or existing features changed without bringing the app down. This ""extensibility"" in our design is becoming more and more important every day as software shops compete with each other for work and even with other countries.

Many books have dedicated chapters to injecting objects into MVC controllers or WPF ViewModels, but not many have focused on the meat of a system, the business tiers.

hibernate-introduction,Introduction To Hibernate,14288,2013-07-30T00:00:00Z,"In the world of Java, one of the most popular and widely used frameworks is Hibernate. Hibernate is an ORM, or Object Relational Mapper, that allows developers to map Java objects to relational database tables. It is a valuable tool that all Java developers should know how to use. The problem is, learning Hibernate can be difficult. Hibernate is a very large framework and there are many important concepts to understand to use it effectively. This course is designed to make getting started with Hibernate as easy as possible and focus on the most important things you need to know. We start off this course by learning a bit about Hibernate and how it works, and then see how to get it setup with a real MySQL database installation. After that, we learn the very basics of mapping, which is one of the most important things to understand about Hibernate. I'll show you how to create a basic mapping for a Java object to a relational table and explain to you how the mapping works. But most real world applications have more complex mapping that often trips up new developers and experienced developers alike. So, we'll also cover some of the complex mapping situations like mapping collections and different relational mappings like one-to-many and many-to-one. Once you've learned how to map you objects, you'll want to know how to query them, so I'll show you how to do this using Hibernate's built in HQL and using a more object oriented approach with the Criteria API. Finally, we'll wrap things up by taking a brief tour of some of the more advanced features like caching and interceptors. So, if you are wanting to learn how to use Hibernate, or if you've been struggling through using Hibernate in an existing application, but never really understood what was going on, this course will give you the knowledge you need to feel confident about how Hibernate works and how to use it.",Live,no,John Sonmez,hibernate data object-relational-mapping mysql developer hibernate data object-relational-mapping mysql developer

introduction-building-web-applications-dart,Introduction To Building Web Applications With Dart,9709,2013-06-13T00:00:00Z,"Dart is an exciting new programming language from Google which is designed to eventually replace JavaScript. Dart is an optionally typed language, meaning that it can be as dynamic as JavaScript, but it also has a type system which can give you the benefits of languages like C# and Java. In fact, you'll find that if you already know Java or C#, Dart will seem very familiar to you, since it takes some of the best features of those languages and much of their syntax. Many C# and Java developers find they can start writing Dart code with a very short learning curve. You'll also find that you can start using Dart right now, because Dart code can compile down to standard JavaScript which can run anywhere. In this course, I'll take you through Dart and the Dart platform, and show you the basics of the language. We'll quickly go over the language itself in a single module and then we'll jump right in to building a real web application with Dart and the Dart libraries. You'll learn how to add Dart code to a web page in a very similar fashion that you probably have been doing with JavaScript. You'll also see the power of the Dart language and libraries as we explore some of the advanced data binding and templating features in the Dart Web UI library. We'll wrap up the course by going over some of the advanced features of Dart, like concurrency using isolates instead of threads, and mixins that allow us to get the benefits of inheritance without many of the drawbacks. So, if you've been interested in Dart, but haven't wanted to invest the time into learning a whole new programming language, this course will show you how much about the Dart language you probably already know and get you building a real application quickly. The goal of this course is to make it as easy and painless as possible to get started with Dart and decide if it is something you want to learn more about.",Live,no,John Sonmez,programming-languages google web developer dart javascript programming-languages google web developer dart javascript

Unfortunately, since Meteor is so new, there isn’t a large amount of information available to learn how to develop applications with it. This course is designed to take you through the full process of developing a complete single page application in Meteor using JavaScript and deploying that application to a real production system. We’ll start off by learning about what Meteor is and learning about the technologies that Meteor uses. Then, we’ll dig deep into Meteor to demystify the “magic” around it and discover how Meteor is able to do so much with so little code. Then, we’ll actually create our first Meteor application and along the way we’ll cover some of the code concepts of Meteor needed to create a basic Meteor application. Once we have the basics down, we’ll expand our application and discover some of the more advanced concepts of the platform that really allows us to utilize the power of Meteor. Finally, we’ll go beyond Meteor as we learn how to deploy our application to both the Meteor servers and a Linux machine in the cloud and also discover how to use community created extensions to do things like add routing to our application. So, if you are interested in Meteor and want to see how you can create single page applications entirely in JavaScript with relatively little code, compared to other solutions, check out this course.",Live,no,John Sonmez,spa node.js nosql web ajax open-source developer meteor javascript spa node.js nosql web ajax open-source developer meteor javascript

We first look at how the shift in technology trends established the need for a different breed of technologies. Columnar, or Column-Oriented, databases have become increasingly popular in data warehousing applications because they allow for better compression and multi-fold performance improvements, and we'll see how SQL Server 2014 implements this with clustered columnstore indexes. In addition, as technology makes a bigger shift in hardware to multi-core CPU architectures and large amounts of memory are even cheaper and more attainable, it's important for software to adjust and utilize these changes. We'll see how In-Memory OLTP addresses these trends and more, letting you create tables in memory, eliminating locks and implementing optimistic multi-version concurrency. This course discusses in depth In-Memory OLTP (memory optimized tables), previously known as Hekaton. We'll cover creating memory-optimized tables, loading data, durability and the affect that has on the transaction log. We'll also look at indexing in detail, explaining the new index types created specifically to support In-Memory OLTP and how and when to apply each type based on your use case and we'll discuss how In-Memory OLTP and Clustered Columnstore indexes can fit a variety of applications while comparing them with each other and traditional disk-based tables and indexes.",Live,no,Ahmad Alkilani,sql data admin microsoft data-warehousing developer sql-server sql data admin microsoft data-warehousing developer sql-server

uml-introduction,Introduction to UML,8006,2013-09-09T00:00:00Z,"Seldom does a software project of any size get built by only one person. Most often many different people, with different skills work together to build the solution. It is not uncommon to have the technology not be the most challenging part of the project, but rather it is often the lack of clear communication between the project team members. The Unified Modeling Language (UML) helps the team members to communicate clearly and precisely. The UML includes several diagrams and models that support the design of different aspects of the solution. If each member of the team is able to understand those models that are useful to them they are more likely to understand each other, and the challenges and risks of different understandings and views of the solution are minimized. In this course we review the need for this clear communication. We discuss several of the common diagrams that teams use to model a software solution and identify some of the team members that most commonly use the diagram. The UML is very large and there is much that can be done with it beyond what is covered in this introductory course.
